This project is a comprehensive dashboard application designed for an e-commerce store. It features a main homepage, product management sections including product listing, editing, and creation, as well as order management with similar capabilities. Additionally, it includes a comment display module. The frontend is developed using React with Tailwind CSS for styling and utilizes JavaScript throughout.

The backend is built with Node.js and employs a MySQL database for persistent data storage. Some functionalities, such as comment approval and rejection, are currently under development due to incomplete backend implementation.

The application is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes. To enhance usability and data visualization, third-party libraries have been integrated, including charting tools for analytics and a product zoom feature for detailed viewing.
